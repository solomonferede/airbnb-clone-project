They also collaborate closely with the Database Administrator and DevOps Engineer to ensure reliability, scalability, and performance.

### **Database Administrator (DBA)**

The Database Administrator manages the design, implementation, and optimization of the PostgreSQL database. Their responsibilities include defining efficient database schemas, setting up indexing for performance optimization, handling data migrations, managing backups, and ensuring data integrity and security. The DBA also collaborates with developers to fine-tune queries and caching mechanisms using Redis.

### **DevOps Engineer**

The DevOps Engineer ensures that the development and deployment processes are automated, reliable, and scalable. They configure Docker containers for consistent environments, set up CI/CD pipelines for seamless integration and deployment, and monitor system performance. Their role also involves managing the cloud infrastructure, optimizing deployment workflows, and implementing security and recovery measures.

### **QA Engineer**

The QA Engineer is in charge of maintaining the quality and stability of the system. They develop and execute automated and manual test plans to ensure all backend functionalities meet the project‚Äôs requirements. Their tasks include API testing, performance testing, and validating booking, payment, and review features. The QA Engineer collaborates with developers to identify, report, and resolve issues early in the development lifecycle.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

### **Django**

A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It provides robust features for rapid development, including ORM, authentication, and an admin interface, making it ideal for creating RESTful APIs and handling business logic.

### **Django REST Framework (DRF)**

An extension of Django that simplifies the creation of RESTful APIs. It provides tools for serialization, authentication, permissions, and viewsets, ensuring smooth interaction between the frontend and backend.

### **PostgreSQL**

A powerful open-source relational database used for storing structured data such as users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews. It supports advanced indexing and query optimization for efficient data retrieval.

### **GraphQL**

A flexible query language that allows clients to request only the data they need. It provides a more efficient and precise alternative to REST, improving frontend-backend communication and performance.

### **Celery**

A distributed task queue used for handling asynchronous background tasks, such as sending email notifications, processing payments, and scheduling periodic jobs without blocking the main application flow.

### **Redis**

An in-memory data store used for caching and session management. It helps reduce database load and improve response times by temporarily storing frequently accessed data.

### **Docker**

A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into portable containers. It ensures consistent environments across development, testing, and production.

### **CI/CD Pipelines**

Automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines are used to test, build, and deploy code changes efficiently. They help maintain code quality, speed up releases, and minimize human error during deployment.
